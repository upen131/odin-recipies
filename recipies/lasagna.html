                Lasagna is a classic Italian baked dish made by layering wide, flat
                pasta sheets with rich fillings and sauces. Traditionally, it features
                layers of tender pasta, a savory meat or vegetable sauce (often
                slow-cooked with tomatoes, onions, garlic, and herbs), creamy béchamel
                or ricotta, and generous amounts of melted cheese such as mozzarella
                and Parmesan. When baked, lasagna becomes hearty and comforting: the
                top turns golden and slightly crisp, while the inside stays soft,
                creamy, and deeply flavorful. Variations range from meat-based (like
                beef or pork ragù) to vegetarian versions with spinach, mushrooms, or
                zucchini, making lasagna a versatile and beloved comfort food around
                the world.
