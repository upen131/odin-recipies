            <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>&frac14; cup olive oil</li>
                <li>2 large onions, diced</li>
                <li>&frac13; cup curry powder, or to taste</li>
                <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into strips
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Step by step guidelines:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather the ingredients.

                </li>
                <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat until hot. Add onion and sauté until soft and golden
                    brown, 5 to 8 minutes.

                </li>
                <li>Slowly stir in curry powder until well blended.

                </li>
                <li>Add chicken; reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center
                    and the juices run clear, 20 to 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center
                    should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).

                </li>
                <li>Uncover and cook, stirring constantly to prevent burning, until pan juices reduce to desired amount,
                    3 to 5 minutes.

                </li>
            </ol>
